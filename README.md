# Empty Bottle Detection System

This project aims to develop an additional feature for a cocktail maker robot by implementing an empty bottle detection
system. The objective is to enable the robot to determine whether a bottle is empty or still filled. The development of
this feature is crucial for ensuring efficient and accurate cocktail preparation.

We considered a variety of methodologies, including the utilization of pre-trained AI models. There were certain advantages and disadvantages associated with this approach that influenced our decision not to employ it in this specific project. Currently, our primary focus revolves around the implementation of Python-based image processing code specifically
designed for different bottle types. We aim to significantly improve the system's ability to identify and differentiate
between empty and filled bottles. This approach holds promise for improving the detection accuracy by leveraging
advanced image analysis algorithms.

## Assumptions and Limitations

To achieve this goal, various techniques were explored to capture readable photos of the bottle system for detection
purposes. The initial approach involved utilizing the robot's built-in camera, but it proved ineffective due to
positioning limitations and resulting in unclear images. Subsequently, an alternative method utilizing LED lights and
strips to enhance visibility was attempted, but it did not yield satisfactory results.

### The Robotâ€™s Built-in Camera

The use of the built-in camera of the cocktail maker robot for bottle detection presented several challenges and
limitations, which led us to explore alternative approaches.

- Positioning Constraints: Due to the inherent design and positioning of the robot, it was not feasible to directly face
  the camera towards the bottle area for capturing clear and accurate images. The location of the robot arm, situated at
  the back side of the bottle system, introduced
  numerous obstacles and potential sources of interference between the camera and the bottles. These obstacles
  obstructed the camera's line of sight, further compromising the quality of the captured images and impeding the
  detection process.
  Example:
- Image Resolution: Another limitation was the inadequate resolution of the images captured by the robot's camera. The
  low resolution resulted in a lack of detail, making it difficult to discern the contents of the bottles accurately.
  This constraint significantly hindered the effectiveness of the bottle detection system.

Examples:

- [Image-1](./images/robot-camera-1.png)
- [Image-2](./images/robot-camera-2.png)
- [Image-3](./images/robot-camera-3.png)
- [Image-4](./images/robot-camera-4.png)

### Lights

Another aspect that was explored to enhance the empty bottle detection system was the implementation of lighting
techniques.
However, the trials conducted with different lighting configurations yielded unsatisfactory results. Two different
approaches were attempted, each with its own limitations:

- Single LED Lights on Top of Each Bottle: Initially, single LED lights were placed on top of each bottle in an attempt
  to improve visibility and facilitate differentiation between empty and filled sections. Surprisingly, this approach
  resulted in a deterioration of image quality. The use of individual LED lights added unwanted shadows and uneven
  illumination, making it more challenging to accurately detect the bottle contents.
  Examples:
    - [Image-5](./images/robot-camera-5.png)
    - [Image-6](./images/robot-camera-6.png)
    - [Image-7](./images/robot-camera-7.png)
- LED Strip Placement in the Middle of Bottles: As an alternative, an LED strip was positioned in the middle of the
  bottles to provide uniform lighting and emphasize the distinction between empty and filled parts. However, similar to
  the previous method, this approach also resulted in poorer image quality. The LED strip caused reflections and glares
  on the bottles, introducing additional noise and hindering the accuracy of the bottle detection process.
  Examples:
    - [Image-8](./images/robot-camera-8.png)
    - [Image-9](./images/robot-camera-9.png)
    - [Image-10](./images/robot-camera-10.png)
    - [Image-11](./images/robot-camera-11.png)

In summary, the trials conducted with different lighting techniques, including single LED lights and LED strips, did not
yield the desired results and led to a degradation in image quality. As a result, the decision was made to continue the
bottle detection system development without additional lighting.

### Image Background

Another significant limitation arose from the complexity of the image background. Even if we were to use a camera with
superior image quality and ensure an unobstructed view of the bottle system, the image recognition module would face
difficulties in accurately detecting the bottles due to the irregular and cluttered background. The presence of a
non-uniform or visually busy background can introduce unnecessary visual noise, making it harder for
the image recognition module to distinguish the bottles from their surroundings. This limitation becomes particularly
pronounced when relying on computer vision algorithms that rely on identifying specific patterns and features within the
image.

Examples:

- [Image-12](./images/busy-background-1.JPG)
- [Image-13](./images/busy-background-2.JPG)
- [Image-14](./images/busy-background-3.JPG)
- [Image-15](./images/busy-background-4.JPG)

To address this limitation, we recognized the need for a more controlled environment. It led us to implement a white
background within the system. By utilizing a simple and uniform background, such as white, we aim to reduce background
distractions and improve the accuracy of the bottle detection system. The white background provides a clear contrast
against the bottles, enhancing the visibility of their shapes and features, thereby facilitating more effective image
recognition.

Examples:

- [Image-16](./images/white-background-1.JPG)
- [Image-17](./images/white-background-2.JPG)
- [Image-18](./images/white-background-3.JPG)
- [Image-19](./images/white-background-4.JPG)

## Bottle Extraction from Images

### Testing Failures: Methodologies Discarded

#### Contours

Contours provide an effective way to separate objects from the background, especially when the
background is uniform, such as a white background. However, first we needed to extract the white plane from the whole
image. So that, we planed to apply two level contour finding to first finding contours of the white background image was
the draw the boundaries of the background of the white surface; second outlines of objects these boundaries to precisely
define the extent and shape of the objects, which is crucial for tasks like object detection and segmentation. By
tracing the contours of objects, you can distinguish the shapes of
the objects from the background, making subsequent analysis and object recognition easier.

Steps described below

- The input image is converted into a black and white format, reducing it to a single channel. This simplifies the
  task of identifying object boundaries.
- GaussianBlur is applied to the image to reduce noise and smoothen it. This step helps to make the edges more
  pronounced and continuous.
- Thresholding operation is used to create a binary image, where pixel values below a specified threshold are set to
  black, while those above it are set to white. This binary image serves as the basis for contour detection.
- Apply the Canny edge detection algorithm to the thresholded image. This step will highlight the edges of objects
  within the binary image, making them stand out more.
- The findContours function in OpenCV is then utilized to locate and extract the contours of the bottles within the
  processed image. This algorithm allows for the precise identification and extraction of bottle shapes within the
  image, facilitating subsequent analysis and object recognition tasks in computer vision applications.


### Pre-trained AI models

- Generalization: Pre-trained models, having been trained on extensive datasets, often have a superior ability to generalize from diverse data, making them adaptable to various scenarios and environments. This adaptability can be a significant advantage when dealing with the diverse range of bottle shapes and environmental conditions our system might encounter.
- Lack of Specific Models: One of the primary limitations of pre-trained models is the unavailability of models specifically trained for the task of detecting empty or filled bottles. Most pre-trained models are designed for generic object detection or classification and may not suit the unique characteristics of our application.
- Fine-Tuning Complexity: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a specific task, such as empty bottle detection, can be a complex and resource-intensive process. It often requires a substantial amount of labeled data for the new task and extensive computational resources for training. Given that our project necessitates the identification of bottle fill levels, the costs and complexities associated with fine-tuning a model for this specific purpose were prohibitive.

We considered  pre-trained models for image classification such as VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 for their performance in generic object classification. However, these models, while excellent for general image recognition, do not meet the specific requirements of our bottle detection task. For object detection, we also explored models like Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and SSD. These models are particularly well-suited for identifying and localizing objects within an image. Nevertheless, our project's focus on detecting empty or filled bottles necessitates a custom approach due to the unique nature of our task.
As there are no readily available pre-trained models tailored to the specific task of detecting empty or filled bottles, and fine-tuning these models can be resource-intensive, we opted for a different approach. Instead, we chose to focus on efficient image processing techniques. These techniques, including thresholding, edge detection, and contour analysis, allow us to extract essential features like the bottle's outline and water level without the need for extensive computational resources. This approach aligns with the efficiency requirements of the cocktail machine and the complexities of our diverse real-world operating conditions.

### Methodology - Template Matching

OpenCV template matching is primarily relies on pixel-level comparisons without considering higher-level features. As a
result of our experimentation, template matching mode TM_CCOEFF_NORMED gave the highest performance within 6 modes;
TM_CCOEFF, TM_CCOEFF_NORMED, TM_CCORR, M_CCORR_NORMED, TM_SQDIFF, TM_SQDIFF_NORMED.

we saw that template matching was working incorrectly due to the following items.

- Bottle Shapes: The large variation in bottle shapes, sizes, and orientations can make it challenging to find a single
  template that accurately represents all instances of bottles. Eventhough if we try to get a template for each bottle,
  which is not feasible for the efficiency of the cocktail machine, it does not seem reasonable to solve the problems in
  the next item.
- Environmental Factors: Template matching relies on finding exact matches, and even slight variations in the appearance
  of bottles, such as different lights or reflection can lead to inaccurate results.
  Therefore, alternative approaches such as deep learning-based object detection algorithms, which can learn and
  generalize from large datasets, might be more suitable for reliable bottle detection in diverse real-world scenarios.

As deep learning models require large amounts of labeled training data and extensive computational resources for
training, efficient image processing techniques are chosen when developing an application to find bottle fill level. By
leveraging traditional image processing algorithms such as thresholding, edge detection, and contour analysis, it
becomes possible to extract relevant features like the bottle's outline and water height.
